# Redux Toolkit

It is a better form of good old redux. All the useful packages are a part of this, unlike traditional redux.

To add redux toolkit to our project, we need to install two packages, namely `@reduxjs/toolkit` and `react-redux`

```
npm install @reduxjs/tookit 
npm install react-redux

```

### @reduxjs/toolkit

It consists of few libraries
- redux (core library, state management)
- immer (allows to mutate state)
- redux-thunk (handles async actions)
- reselect (simplifies reducer functions)

#### Extras

- redux devtools
- combine reducers

### react-redux

connects our app to redux
