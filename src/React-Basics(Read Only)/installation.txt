### Create React App ###
Run --> 
1. npx create-react-app <folder_name>
2. cd <folder_name>
3. npm install (For installing all the dependencies)
4. npm start

We have to connect all our code to index.js file for the react-app to work.

### Vite ###

Run -->
1. npm create vite@latest <folder_name> -- --template react
2. cd <folder_name>
3. npm install (For installing all the dependencies)
4. npm run dev

Important: 
-------------
i. We need to use .jsx extension instead of .js
ii. index.html is located in the root directory instead of public (as in create-react-app)
iii. Here, all the code goes in main.jsx instead of index.js
iv. For using variables from .env, we need to use => import.meta.env.VARIABLE_NAME
