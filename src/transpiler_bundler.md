## Transpiler

Modern JS features are only supported in a few popular browsers. However, for the sake of browser compatibility, we need to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript. It is done by transpilers like Babel, SWC etc. 

## Bundler

As the name suggests, it basically creates one or more files with all the JS modules and some other dependencies, which can be deployed. Examples are webpack, rollup etc.
